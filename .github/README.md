# 110 -- HTML, CSS, & basic static sites

_**Note:** If you're just finding this repo and have no idea what it's all about, welcome! This is part of my "learn web development on your own using (mostly) free resources" course-like thing. If you're interested, you'll actually want to start with [the first module](https://github.com/nickcannariato/intro-to-web-and-computers)._

---

Now that you have a high-level understanding of how both computers and the internet work, we're gonna begin our journey by learning the most fundamental languages of the web: HTML & CSS.

100% of every site on the web is, at the end of the day, using HTML and CSS to display text to you and style it. No matter what fancy framework is popular at the moment or what neckbeard-edgelord developers in their basement say, at the end of the day we're all just slinging HTML and CSS.

As a result, we're going to spend _a lot_ of time here before moving on to anything else. No matter what language you learn, what your role winds up being, or where you work: HTML and CSS will always be something you need.

## Resources

1. [Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)
    - A note on the above :point_up:: Udacity has paid tracks that I find to be fairly hit-and-miss when it comes to both content and the way it prepares people. Having said that, they _do_ have some pretty great free courses that we'll refer to along the way. You can create an account at the site and then enroll in _just_ this free course to take it, and that will be the first and best place to start.
2. [Internetting is Hard: Semantic HTML](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/)
3. [Specificity Weight](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/intermediate/specificity/)
4. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
    - You won't be doing a _ton_ of work on Free Code Camp, having said that, the "Responsive Web Design Certification" portion of their course is really great and provides a pretty good walk through of a lot of different concepts. Some of it will review the information in the Udacity course you took above, and some of it will be new (like the CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid portions), but all practice is good practice.
5. [Wes Bos: What the Flexbox!?](https://flexbox.io/)
    - If I'm teaching/helping you personally, I've already purchased a copy of this course for you. Check the shared Google Drive folder to find/download it.
6. [Wes Bos: CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/)
7. [**BONUS:** CSS in-depth v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-in-depth-v2/)
    - It's totally not necessary to take this course, but it's a _masters_ course in how CSS works. If you don't have time to take it now, put it in your back pocket for later. Use the credentials I provided you to access the site.
8. [**BONUS:** Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WkwAkcSdlZSRQ==/)
    - I, unfortunately, can't provide you credentials for this one. It's a _really_ great course, and if it's on sale (which Udemy does like every week) it should be around $11. I definitely recommend taking it if you can.
